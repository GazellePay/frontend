**GazellePay**





**Description**

GazellePay is a GoFundMe for opensource projects built on the polygon network. 

GazellePay is the easiest and transparent way specifically designed to allow anyone to transfer value (in the form of MATIC) to anyone on the GazellePay Platform using their unique url. 

GazellePay achieves these goals through two approaches. First, GazellePay presents a simple and instructional UI that walks users through the process of transferring value, explaining in simple English what is happening along the way. 

Second, GazellePay minimizes steps by integrating key DeFi tools such as Polygon.

For phase 1, users are able to send MATIC to a variety of different users on the GazellePay platform.

Phase 2, allows to send MATIC to users on the GazellePay platform across a variety of different tokens on the Polygon network.
